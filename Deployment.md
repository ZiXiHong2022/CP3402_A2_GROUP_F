# Nicepage
We passed nicepage as local hosting, and after some discussion our group decided that this was the best way to host it. With nicepage we are able to get started and expand the site very quickly


# Wordpress
Subsequently we used wordpress, wordpress has a lot of plugins, very simple functions, very friendly for all of us to use, wordpress responds very well on many devices, which allows users to open our website quickly on any device, and wordpress is free and open.
